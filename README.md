# MARKOV-OPTIMIZER
Creating a **Control Theory** model for a **Markov Optimizer** involves applying the principles of feedback control systems to dynamically adjust and optimize hyperparameters during training, based on the feedback (loss, gradient) provided by the system. Here, the **Markov Optimizer** evolves its hyperparameters (such as learning rate, momentum, etc.) to achieve optimal performance over time.

### **Control Theory for Markov Optimizer**

In control theory, a **feedback control system** is designed to automatically adjust its parameters to achieve a desired output or minimize error (e.g., loss in optimization problems). The main components of a feedback system are:

1. **Reference (Setpoint)**: The desired state (e.g., the optimal loss or desired gradient norm).
2. **Controller**: An algorithm or mechanism that adjusts the system’s input (hyperparameters) based on the error between the current state and the reference.
3. **Process (Plant)**: The system being optimized, e.g., the model and its training process.
4. **Feedback**: The error or difference between the desired and current states (loss, gradient norms).

In the context of the **Markov Optimizer**, the system can be modeled as follows:

---

### **1. Feedback Loop**

We will define the **feedback loop** based on the optimization process. The optimization error is the difference between the current loss or gradient norm and the target value (e.g., a stable gradient norm or a small loss).

* **Target (Setpoint)**: The optimizer’s goal is to maintain an ideal effective step size $\gamma^*$ (based on the gradient norm).
* **Controller (Markov Coefficients)**: The Markov coefficients adjust the learning rate and momentum based on the error (loss, gradient norms).
* **Plant (Model and Gradients)**: The model itself, with its parameters, gradients, and training process, forms the plant in this control system.
* **Feedback (Gradient Norm)**: The optimizer uses the gradient norm as feedback to adjust its parameters and minimize the optimization error.

---

### **2. Dynamic System and Feedback Control**

A **Markov Optimizer** can be treated as a **control system** where the **state variables** include:

* The model’s current **parameters**.
* The **gradient norms** and **loss**.
* The **hyperparameters** (learning rate, momentum, etc.).

The **control signal** in this context is the adjustment of the optimizer’s hyperparameters based on the feedback (gradient norms and loss).

#### **Markov Process for Control**

1. **State Variables**: The system’s state consists of the model's parameters $\mathbf{p}$, gradients $\mathbf{g}$, and the loss function $L$. At each step $t$, we observe:

   $$
   \mathbf{x}(t) = \{ \mathbf{p}(t), \mathbf{g}(t), L(t) \}
   $$

   where $\mathbf{p}(t)$ are the model parameters, $\mathbf{g}(t)$ is the gradient, and $L(t)$ is the loss.

2. **System Dynamics (State Evolution)**: The parameters evolve based on the optimizer’s update rule. The state transition from time $t$ to $t+1$ is given by the following equation:

   $$
   \mathbf{p}(t+1) = \mathbf{p}(t) + \alpha(t) \cdot \mathbf{g}(t)
   $$

   where $\alpha(t)$ is the adaptive learning rate.

3. **Error Dynamics (Loss Feedback)**: The **error** is the difference between the target effective step size $\gamma^*$ and the current value of $\alpha(t) \cdot \mathbf{g}(t)$, which can be adjusted to minimize the loss. The error is given by:

   $$
   \text{error}(t) = \gamma^* - \alpha(t) \cdot \|\mathbf{g}(t)\|
   $$

   The error drives the controller to adjust the learning rate and momentum.

4. **Controller (Markov Coefficients)**: The Markov coefficients $\alpha(t)$ and $\beta(t)$ evolve over time based on the error feedback. A simple rule is:

   $$
   \alpha(t+1) = \alpha(t) + \lambda_{\alpha} \cdot \text{error}(t)
   $$

   $$
   \beta(t+1) = \beta(t) + \lambda_{\beta} \cdot \text{error}(t)
   $$

   where $\lambda_{\alpha}$ and $\lambda_{\beta}$ are the learning rates for adjusting the learning rate and momentum.

5. **Feedback (Gradient Norm)**: The feedback in the system is provided by the gradient norms, which are used to update the learning rate and momentum, allowing the optimizer to control the evolution of the model’s parameters.

---

### **3. Control Theory Model: Markov Optimizer**

We can model the Markov Optimizer as a **discrete-time control system**. The optimizer adjusts the learning rate and momentum dynamically based on the error between the current state (gradient norm and loss) and the target values.

Let’s define the **control loop**:

1. **Input (Controller)**: The optimizer adjusts the learning rate ($\alpha(t)$) and momentum ($\beta(t)$) based on feedback from the gradient and loss.

2. **Process (Plant)**: The model's parameters evolve with the optimizer’s updates, which are based on the gradients of the loss function.

3. **Output**: The feedback signal is the gradient norm and the loss, which are used to adjust the optimizer’s hyperparameters in the next iteration.

#### **Markov Optimizer Control Loop:**

1. **State Update**:

   $$
   \mathbf{p}(t+1) = \mathbf{p}(t) - \alpha(t) \cdot \mathbf{g}(t) + \beta(t) \cdot \mathbf{p}(t)
   $$

   where $\alpha(t)$ is the learning rate and $\beta(t)$ is the momentum.

2. **Error Calculation**:

   $$
   \text{error}(t) = \gamma^* - \alpha(t) \cdot \|\mathbf{g}(t)\|
   $$

   The optimizer uses this error to adjust $\alpha(t)$ and $\beta(t)$.

3. **Adaptive Update**:

   $$
   \alpha(t+1) = \alpha(t) + \lambda_{\alpha} \cdot \text{error}(t)
   $$

   $$
   \beta(t+1) = \beta(t) + \lambda_{\beta} \cdot \text{error}(t)
   $$

### **4. Stability and Convergence**

The **stability** of this control system is dependent on the choice of the learning rate $\alpha(t)$ and momentum $\beta(t)$. The optimizer will stabilize when the error is minimized, i.e., when the learning rate and momentum are properly adapted based on the gradient and loss feedback.

#### **Stability Conditions:**

1. The learning rate and momentum should be **bounded** to avoid instability. The optimization process can become unstable if the learning rate is too large.
2. **Momentum** helps prevent oscillations by providing inertia to the parameter updates.

### **5. Practical Implementation: Markov Optimizer**

Here is an implementation of the Markov Optimizer control theory in code:

```python
import torch
import math
from torch.optim.optimizer import Optimizer

class MarkovOptimizer(Optimizer):
    def __init__(self, params, lr=1e-3, momentum=0.9, gamma_star=0.1):
        defaults = dict(lr=lr, momentum=momentum)
        super(MarkovOptimizer, self).__init__(params, defaults)

        self.state = {
            "ema_gnorm": 0.0,
            "step": 0,
            "prev_step": None,
        }

        self.gamma_star = gamma_star

    @torch.no_grad()
    def step(self, closure=None, loss=None):
        self.state["step"] += 1

        gnorm_total = 0.0
        for group in self.param_groups:
            for p in group['params']:
                if p.grad is not None:
                    gnorm_total += p.grad.detach().pow(2).sum().item()
        gnorm = math.sqrt(gnorm_total + 1e-12)

        if self.state["prev_step"] is None:
            self.state["prev_step"] = torch.zeros_like(p.data)

        for group in self.param_groups:
            lr = group['lr']
            dlog = 1e-3 * ((self.gamma_star - lr * gnorm) /
                           (self.gamma_star + 1e-12))  # resonance lock adjustment
            lr = math.exp(math.log(lr) + max(-0.05, min(0.05, dlog)))
            lr = min(max(lr, 1e-5), 0.05)
            group['lr'] = lr

            momentum = group.get('momentum', 0.0)
            group['momentum'] = momentum

        ema_g = self.state["ema_gnorm"] * 0.98 + gnorm * 0.02
        self.state["ema_gnorm"] = ema_g

        for group in self.param_groups:
            momentum = group.get('momentum', 0.0)
            for p in group['params']:
                if p.grad is None:
                    continue
                d_p = p.grad
                state = self.state.setdefault(p, {})
                if "momentum_buffer" not in state:
                    buf = state["momentum_buffer"] = torch.clone(d_p).detach()
                else:
                    buf = state["momentum_buffer"]
                    buf.mul_(momentum).add_(d_p)
                p.data.add_(buf, alpha=-group['lr'])

        return loss
```

### **Conclusion**

This **Markov Optimizer** model integrates control theory principles by adjusting the optimizer’s hyperparameters (learning rate, momentum) dynamically based on feedback from the loss function and gradient norm. The control system’s goal is to maintain the optimizer's effective step size near a target value $\gamma^*$, while using resonance lock and other mechanisms to improve the optimization process.
